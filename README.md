- 👋 Hi, I’m @jtnovoamatte
- 👀 I’m interested in programming human solutions for a dayly basis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic programming languages as HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript and SQL to build a system from scratch, and also I'm have been learning Solidity to build (and play) with Smart Contracts, NFT and Subcoins.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software and product development.
