- 👋 Hi, I’m José Tomás
- 👀 I’m interested in programming human solutions for daily basis needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic programming with HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and SQL to build a system from scratch. And also playing between Solidity and smart contracts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software and product development.
- 📫 How to reach me? Message me to jonovoa@uc.cl
